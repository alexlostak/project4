/*
 * Jonah Harris - Critter 2 of 2
 * 
 * Critter1 acts as a cheetah; that is, it fights any critters for food. It reproduces at
 * energy level 200 as it needs a lot of energy to keep running. This critter runs in a 
 * straight line either left or right, looking for prey. When the stats method is called, 
 * data is output showing the total cheetahs going left, right, and how many laps all the 
 * combined cheetahs have ran based on the world width.
